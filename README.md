# Wikipedia Desktop Browser
Had this idea for a while, and it's finally here

## Usage:
Install git

After you installed git run this command in the cmd `git clone https://github.com/deb06/Wikipedia`

Install following modules:
  `pip install wikipedia`
  `pip install tkinterhtml`
 
Finally cd into the folder you cloned and run the python file, `py __main__.py`
